Create an Inventory Program that:

1. Lists items in tbe inventory
2. Allows a user to select an item and view the inventory count,
- change the number of the inventory,
- delete the item altogether,
- or change the name.
3. Create a new item and give the item an inventory count, and have this item now show up in the list of items you can select.
4. Loops through until the user does not want to edit the list anymore.
A couple of helpful suggestions for the Inventory Assignment -
- your inventory only needs to consist of 3 - 6 items. (don’t spend a lot of time making a massive inventory)
- You can use arrays, but I find it’s easier to use a hash. that what you can assign a key (the inventory item) and a value (the quantity). However, that could just be the way my brain works. so… do whatever works best for you.
- Finally…
… Break this down into manageable parts
1. Create a list of items and get them to display
2. celebrate and grab some coffee
3. Create a way for the user to select/view an item
4. Create a way for the user to delete the item
5. Create a way for the user to edit the item
6. celebrate again
7. Create a way for a new item to be added
8. Make that item show up in the inventory list
9. celebrate and grab more coffee
10. Make the program ask the user if they want to continue editing or exit, and allow them to terminate the program
11. Celebrate and realize that you’re awesome.
